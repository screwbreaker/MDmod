# MDmod PDK
Mega Drive switchless MOD for Padauk microcontroller

![Board](https://github.com/screwbreaker/MDmod/blob/main/PIC/render/MD_Mod_top.png?raw=true)

### Summary
This mod is writted for the PIC16F630 microcontroller.
This mod is written with the SDCC. Maybe the SDCC is not the best for PIC, but it do the job very well.

### How to compile and program
This MOD must be compiled with [SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/).
To program the micro I suggest the [Minipro/XGecu](http://www.xgecu.com/en/) programmer.
But i'm sure it can be programmed with the PICKit.

To manually compile it the "--use-non-free" parameter must be set.
Otherwire use the MAKEFILE in the firmware directory.

### License
The PCBs are under the CERN OHL license.
The firmwares, under the GPL3.

This is an OPEN project.
So, like any other project like this, the hope is that others can improve it an reshare with the community.
Don't go out this basic guideline.
